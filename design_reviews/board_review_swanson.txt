wrong motor decoupling caps on motor drivers.

Why do yo uhave a jumper between pwm and gnd?

You are using the wrong diodes on your motor controllers.

Your motor drivers are connect to GND instead of BAT_GND

Power
=====
Wrong cap on input to voltage regulator.  There should only be one.

All the wires that carry high-current need to be high current.  These include those that connect the battery terminals to the jumper, jumper to voltage regulator. etc.

The battery terinals, the jumper and the voltage regulator should all be close to one another.

DRC
=====

Lots of errors. Make sur you are using the new DRU file when autorouting.


Motor holders
=====

the sides of your motor holders are too thin.

Pours
=====

You need separate pours for BATGND and GND.

Antenna
=====

Your antenna looks nothing like the red board.  It needs to compact, symetrical, with short wires.



Oscillator
=====

Needs to look like red board.

decoupling
=====

Your decoupling caps need to be closer to the microcontroller and IMU

Voltage regulator
=====
 see above.

Reset button
=====

you don't have a reset button.

Jumper
=====


Misc
=====

One of your headers is hanging off the board.

Lots of stuff on the bottom of the board.  It's hard to solder down there.

commit 9b5eac070b5dd4294adf450c18d93ea41605c31c

You have no ground pours around your antenna driver

Your ground pours run under your antenna

you need separate GND and BAT_GND pours.


you are missing the decouping caps on all your motor drivers.
