Why is there a 100Ohm resister between gnd and BAT_GND.  You need a wire bridge.

your resistor and capacitor are backwards in the motor driver.  The resistor needs to come bofer the cap.

You don't need the caps between the antenna outputs and the antenna driver.  See the lab write up.

No attributes are set on your custom LEDS.  I also suspect your resistor values aren't quite right, but I can't tell because there are no part numbers on the schematic symbols for the LEDs.

Your IMU is not enabled.  Check for other pins that should be connected.  Read the data sheet.

VDD_IO on your IMU is not connected to power.

Some of the pins on your IMU are not labeled propenly.  I don't know what P$5 is supposed to be.  Whatever it is, there shouldn't be a 10k resistor between it and power.

GND symbols should always point down.

You have one two many occislators on your micro controller.


overall, there's a bunch of basic stuff described in the lab that you haven't done.  You need to pay much closer attention to detail if you want your board to work.
